# Configuration

?> **You need a [Pagaio account][pagaio account] first.**


Then you just have to go to the `System > Configuration` page, tab `PAGAIO Main configuration`.

In that section you need to:

- Enable the extension.
- Enter your API key.
- Set if you want the debug mode or not (useful when you are a developer).

![Configuration](./img/config1.png?raw=true)


Next you have to enable all the webhooks by clicking the `Generate webhooks` button:

![Webhooks](./img/config2.png?raw=true)


When it's done, you should have something like that:

![Configuration](./img/config3.png?raw=true)


You can remove some webhooks if you don't want them. As example, if you don't need the `Customer created` webhook, because you're not using it, you can remove it.

You'll get something like this with of course the button to generate the missing webhooks:

![Configuration](./img/config4.png?raw=true)

You're set!
